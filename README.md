# Genesis 37

## Introduction

This website was created for a theatre company named Genome to showcase their theatre piece Genesis 37. It focus on providing excisting and new fans to find the relevant information about upcoming events, Genesis 37's goals and to get to know the creators. 

Genesis 37 was created during lockdown by former University students Amalia and Argy. With their final theatre project being moved from the classroom to Zoom online they took the opportunity to continue the project further and get more people involved in a virtual theatre experience. The purpose of this website is to continue their goal to make virtual theatre the new normal and to show that theatre is not dead because of Covid-19 that has stopped the live theatre for the time beeing. 

This is the first project out of the four Milestone Projects to be completed in Full Stack Web Development Program at Code Institute.
